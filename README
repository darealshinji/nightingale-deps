Nightingale Build Dependencies
================================

This repo is based on the SVN dependencies from Songbird. Currently,
this repo only works 100% for sure with Linux. Linux only requires the
sqlite, taglib, and xulrunner dependencies.

Right now, both debug and release versions of these three dependencies 
will be built, in the future build.sh will allow you to choose.

Building
================================

To build, simply run build.sh if on Linux. Mac and Windows support coming
soon.

To install build-dependencies on Debian-based systems run:
sudo apt-get install automake autoconf2.13 libtool cmake unzip zip \
 libasound2-dev libbz2-dev libcairo2-dev libevent-dev libfreetype6-dev \
 libgnomevfs2-dev libgtk2.0-dev libharfbuzz-dev libhunspell-dev libidl-dev \
 libjpeg-dev libnotify-dev libnspr4-dev libnss3-dev libpixman-1-dev \
 libpng12-dev libsqlite3-dev libxext-dev libxt-dev zlib1g-dev

To create hardened builds run lint-build.sh.
lint-build.sh also features the following options:
 --disable-debug: disables debugging builds for xulrunner
 --arch=ARCH: force architecture ARCH, useful if you want to build i686
              binaries on a x86_64 system
